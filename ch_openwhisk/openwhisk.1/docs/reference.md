# OpenWhisk system details

The following sections provide more details about the OpenWhisk system.

## OpenWhisk entities

### Namespaces and packages

OpenWhisk actions, triggers, and rules belong in a namespace, and optionally a package.

Packages can contain actions and feeds. A package cannot contain another package, so package nesting is not allowed. Also, entities do not have to be contained in a package.

In Bluemix, an organization+space pair corresponds to a OpenWhisk namespace. For example, the organization `BobsOrg` and space `dev` would correspond to the OpenWhisk namespace `/BobsOrg_dev`.

You can create your own namespaces if you're entitled to do so. The `/whisk.system` namespace is reserved for entities that are distributed with the OpenWhisk system.


### Fully qualified names

The fully qualified name of an entity is
`/namespaceName[/packageName]/entityName`. Notice that `/` is used to delimit namespaces, packages, and entities.

If the fully qualified name has three parts:
`/namespaceName/packageName/entityName`, then the namespace can be entered without a prefixed `/`; otherwise, namespaces must be prefixed with a `/`.

For convenience, the namespace can be left off if it is the user's *default namespace*.

For example, consider a user whose default namespace is `/myOrg`. Following are examples of the fully qualified names of a number of entities and their aliases.

| Fully qualified name | Alias | Namespace | Package | Name |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/whisk.system/cloudant/read` |  | `/whisk.system` | `cloudant` | `read` |
| `/myOrg/video/transcode` | `video/transcode` | `/myOrg` | `video` | `transcode` |
| `/myOrg/filter` | `filter` | `/myOrg` |  | `filter` |

You will be using this naming scheme when you use the OpenWhisk CLI, among other places.

### Entity names

The names of all entities, including actions, triggers, rules, packages, and namespaces, are a sequence of characters that follow the following format:

* The first character must be an alphanumeric character, or an underscore.
* The subsequent characters can be alphanumeric, spaces, or any of the following: `_`, `@`, `.`, `-`.
* The last character can't be a space.

More precisely, a name must match the following regular expression (expressed with Java metacharacter syntax): `\A([\w]|[\w][\w@ .-]*[\w@.-]+)\z`.


## Action semantics

The following sections describe details about OpenWhisk actions.

### Statelessness

Action implementations should be stateless, or *idempotent*. While the system does not enforce this property, there is no guarantee that any state maintained by an action will be available across invocations.

Moreover, multiple instantiations of an action might exist, with each instantiation having its own state. An action invocation might be dispatched to any of these instantiations.

### Invocation input and output

The input to and output from an action is a dictionary of key-value pairs. The key is a string, and the value a valid JSON value.

### Invocation ordering of actions

Invocations of an action are not ordered. If the user invokes an action twice from the command line or the REST API, the second invocation might run before the first. If the actions have side effects, they might be observed in any order.

Additionally, there is no guarantee that actions will execute atomically. Two actions can run concurrently and their side effects can be interleaved. OpenWhisk does not ensure any particular concurrent consistency model for side effects. Any concurrency side effects will be implementation-dependent.

### Action execution guarantees

When an invocation request is received, the system records the request and dispatches an activation.

The system returns an activation ID (in the case of a nonblocking invocation) to confirm that the invocation was received.
Notice that if there's a network failure or other failure which intervenes before you receive an HTTP response, it is possible
that OpenWhisk received and processed the request.

The system attempts to invoke the action once, resulting in one of the following four outcomes:
- *success*: the action invocation completed successfully.
- *application error*: the action invocation was successful, but the action returned an error value on purpose, for instance because a precondition on the arguments was not met.
- *action developer error*: the action was invoked, but it completed abnormally, for instance the action did not detect an exception, or a syntax error existed.
- *whisk internal error*: the system was unable to invoke the action.
The outcome is recorded in the `status` field of the activation record, as document in a following section.

Every invocation that is successfully received, and that the user might be billed for, will eventually have an activation record.

Note that in the case of *action developer error*, the action may have partially run and generated externally visible
side effects.   It is the user's responsibility to check whether such side effects actually happened, and issue retry
logic if desired.   Also note that certain *whisk internal errors* will indicate that an action started running but the
system failed before the action registered completion.

## Activation record

Each action invocation and trigger firing results in an activation record.

An activation record contains the following fields:

- *activationId*: The activation ID.
- *start* and *end*: Timestamps recording the start and end of the activation. The values are in [UNIX time format](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap04.html#tag_04_15).
- *namespace* and `name`: The namespace and name of the entity.
- *logs*: An array of strings with the logs that are produced by the action during its activation. Each array element corresponds to a line output to `stdout` or `stderr` by the action, and includes the time and stream of the log output. The structure is as follows: `TIMESTAMP STREAM: LOG_OUTPUT`.
- *response*: A dictionary that defines the keys `success`, `status`, and `result`:
  - *status*: The activation result, which might be one of the following values: "success", "application error", "action developer error", "whisk internal error".
  - *success*: Is `true` if and only if the status is `"success"`
- *result*: A dictionary that contains the activation result. If the activation was successful, this contains the value that is returned by the action. If the activation was unsuccessful, `result` contains the `error` key, generally with an explanation of the failure.


## JavaScript actions

### Function prototype

OpenWhisk JavaScript actions run in a Node.js runtime.

Actions written in JavaScript must be confined to a single file. The file can contain multiple functions but by convention a function called `main` must exist and is the one called when the action is invoked. For example, the following is an example of an action with multiple functions.

```javascript
function main() {
    return { payload: helper() }
}
function helper() {
    return new Date();
}
```

The action input parameters are passed as a JSON object as a parameter to the `main` function. The result of a successful activation is also a JSON object but is returned differently depending on whether the action is synchronous or asynchronous as described in the following section.


### Synchronous and asynchronous behavior

It is common for JavaScript functions to continue execution in a callback function even after a return. To accommodate this, an activation of a JavaScript action can be *synchronous* or *asynchronous*.

A JavaScript action's activation is **synchronous** if the main function exits under one of the following conditions:

- The main function exits without executing a `return` statement.
- The main function exits by executing a `return` statement that returns any value *except* a Promise.

Here is an example of a synchronous action.

```javascript
// an action in which each path results in a synchronous activation
function main(params) {
  if (params.payload == 0) {
     return {};
  } else if (params.payload == 1) {
     return {payload: 'Hello, World!'};
  } else if (params.payload == 2) {
    return {error: 'payload must be 0 or 1'};
  }
}
```

A JavaScript action's activation is **asynchronous** if the main function exits by returning a Promise.  In this case, the system assumes that the action is still running, until the Promise has been fulfilled or rejected.
Start by instantiating a new Promise object and passing it a callback function. The callback takes two arguments, resolve and reject, which are both functions. All your asynchronous code goes inside that callback.


The following is an example on how to fulfill a Promise by calling the resolve function.

```javascript
function main(args) {
     return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
       setTimeout(function() {
         resolve({ done: true });
       }, 100);
    })
 }
```

The following is an example on how to reject a Promise by calling the reject function.

```javascript
function main(args) {
     return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
       setTimeout(function() {
         reject({ done: true });
       }, 100);
    })
 }
```

It is possible for an action to be synchronous on some inputs and asynchronous on others. The following is an example.

```javascript
  function main(params) {
      if (params.payload) {
         // asynchronous activation
         return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
                setTimeout(function() {
                  resolve({ done: true });
                }, 100);
             })
      }  else {
         // synchronous activation
         return {done: true};
      }
  }
```

Notice that regardless of whether an activation is synchronous or asynchronous, the invocation of the action can be blocking or non-blocking.

### JavaScript global whisk object removed

The global object `whisk` has been removed; migrate your nodejs actions to use alternative methods.
For the functions `whisk.invoke()` and `whisk.trigger()` use the already installed client library [openwhisk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openwhisk).
For the `whisk.getAuthKey()` you can get the API key value from the environment variable `__OW_API_KEY`.
For the `whisk.error()` you can return a rejected Promise (i.e. Promise.reject).

### JavaScript runtime environments

## Swift actions

### Swift 3
Swift 3 actions are executed using Swift 3.1.1  `--kind swift:3.1.1` or Swift 3.0.2 `--kind swift:3`, respectively.  
The default `--kind swift:default` is Swift 3.1.1.

**Note:** The actions you created using the kind `swift:3` will continue to work for a short period, however you should begin migrating your deployment scripts and recompiling your swift actions using the new kind `swift:3.1.1`.


Swift 3.0.2 actions can use the following packages:
- KituraNet version 1.0.1, https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura-net
- SwiftyJSON version 14.2.0, https://github.com/IBM-Swift/SwiftyJSON
- IBM Swift Watson SDK version 0.4.1, https://github.com/IBM-Swift/swift-watson-sdk

Swift 3.1.1 actions can use the following packages:
- KituraNet version 1.7.6, https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura-net
- SwiftyJSON version 15.0.1, https://github.com/IBM-Swift/SwiftyJSON
- Watson Developer Cloud SDK version 0.16.0, https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/swift-sdk

## PHP actions

PHP actions are executed using PHP 7.1. To use this runtime, specify the `wsk` CLI parameter `--kind php:7.1` when creating or updating an action. This is the default when creating an action with file that has a `.php` extension.

The following PHP extensions are available in addition to the standard ones:

- bcmath
- curl
- gd
- intl
- mbstring
- mysqli
- pdo_mysql
- pdo_pgsql
- pdo_sqlite
- soap
- zip

### Composer packages

The following Composer packages are also available:

- guzzlehttp/guzzle       v6.3.0
- ramsey/uuid             v3.6.1

## Docker actions

Docker actions run a user-supplied binary in a Docker container. The binary runs in a Docker image based on [python:3.6.1-alpine](https://hub.docker.com/r/library/python), so the binary must be compatible with this distribution.

The Docker skeleton is a convenient way to build OpenWhisk-compatible Docker images. You can install the skeleton with the `wsk sdk install docker` CLI command.

The main binary program must be located in `/action/exec` inside the container. The executable receives the input arguments via a single command-line argument string which can be deserialized as a `JSON` object. It must return a result via `stdout` as a single-line string of serialized `JSON`.

You may include any compilation steps or dependencies by modifying the `Dockerfile` included in the `dockerSkeleton`.

## REST API
Information about the REST API can be found [here](rest_api.md)


## System limits

### Actions
OpenWhisk has a few system limits, including how much memory an action can use and how many action invocations are allowed per minute.

**Note:** This default limits are for the open source distribution; production deployments like Bluemix likely have higher limits.
As an operator or developer you can change some of the limits using [ansible inventory variables](../ansible/README.md#changing-limits).

The following table lists the default limits for actions.

| limit | description | configurable | unit | default |
| ----- | ----------- | ------------ | -----| ------- |
| timeout | a container is not allowed to run longer than N milliseconds | per action |  milliseconds | 60000 |
| memory | a container is not allowed to allocate more than N MB of memory | per action | MB | 256 |
| logs | a container is not allowed to write more than N MB to stdout | per action | MB | 10 |
| concurrent | no more than N activations may be submitted per namespace either executing or queued for execution | per namespace | number | 100 |
| minuteRate | no more than N activations may be submitted per namespace per minute | per namespace | number | 120 |
| codeSize | the maximum size of the actioncode | not configurable, limit per action | MB | 48 |
| parameters | the maximum size of the parameters that can be attached | not configurable, limit per action/package/trigger | MB | 1 |

### Per action timeout (ms) (Default: 60s)
* The timeout limit N is in the range [100ms..300000ms] and is set per action in milliseconds.
* A user can change the limit when creating the action.
* A container that runs longer than N milliseconds is terminated.

### Per action memory (MB) (Default: 256MB)
* The memory limit M is in the range from [128MB..512MB] and is set per action in MB.
* A user can change the limit when creating the action.
* A container cannot have more memory allocated than the limit.

### Per action logs (MB) (Default: 10MB)
* The log limit N is in the range [0MB..10MB] and is set per action.
* A user can change the limit when creating or updating the action.
* Logs that exceed the set limit are truncated and a warning is added as the last output of the activation to indicate that the activation exceeded the set log limit.

### Per action artifact (MB) (Fixed: 48MB)
* The maximum code size for the action is 48MB.
* It is recommended for a JavaScript action to use a tool to concatenate all source code including dependencies into a single bundled file.

### Per activation payload size (MB) (Fixed: 1MB)
* The maximum POST content size plus any curried parameters for an action invocation or trigger firing is 1MB.

### Per namespace concurrent invocation (Default: 100)
* The number of activations that are either executing or queued for execution for a namespace cannot exceed 100.
* A user is currently not able to change the limits.

### Invocations per minute (Fixed: 120)
* The rate limit N is set to 120 and limits the number of action invocations in one minute windows.
* A user cannot change this limit when creating the action.
* A CLI or API call that exceeds this limit receives an error code corresponding to HTTP status code `429: TOO MANY REQUESTS`.

### Size of the parameters (Fixed: 1MB)
* The size limit for the parameters on creating or updating of an action/package/trigger is 1MB.
* The limit cannot be changed by the user.
* An entity with too big parameters will be rejected on trying to create or update it.

### Per Docker action open files ulimit (Fixed: 64:64)
* The maximum number of open file is 64 (for both hard and soft limits).
* The docker run command use the argument `--ulimit nofile=64:64`.
* For more information about the ulimit for open files see the [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run) documentation.

### Per Docker action processes ulimit (Fixed: 512:512)
* The maximum number of processes available to a user is 512 (for both hard and soft limits).
* The docker run command use the argument `--ulimit nproc=512:512`.
* For more information about the ulimit for maximum number of processes see the [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run) documentation.

### Triggers

Triggers are subject to a firing rate per minute as documented in the table below.

| limit | description | configurable | unit | default |

* A user cannot change this limit when creating the trigger.
* A CLI or API call that exceeds this limit receives an error code corresponding to HTTP status code `429: TOO MANY REQUESTS`.
