A Webhook is Parse could be created by going to **Core | Webhook** and click at the small **Create Webhook** link.

There are 2 kinds of Webhook, CloudCode and Trigger.
The kind of it we are using in this chapter is Trigger.
A Webhook trigger could hook into many places like beforeSave, afterSave, beforeDelete, and afterDelete.

In the example we discussing in this chapter, beforeSave trigger will be used.
