# How to setup OpenWhisk with Docker Compose

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/apache/incubator-openwhisk-devtools.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/apache/incubator-openwhisk-devtools)

An easy way to try OpenWhisk locally is to use Docker Compose.

#### Prerequisites

The following are required to build and deploy OpenWhisk with Docker Compose:

- Mac OSX:
    - [Docker for Mac](https://www.docker.com/docker-mac) - only this currently works on Mac OSX
      + Install via homebrew: `brew cask install docker`
- Other Systems:
    - [Docker 1.12+](https://www.docker.com/products/docker)
    - [Docker Compose 1.6+](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)

These ports must be available:

- `80` and `443` for the API Gateway
- `2181` for Zookeeper
- `5984` for CouchDB
- `8085` for OpenWhisk's Invoker
- `8888` for OpenWhisk's Controller
- `9092` for Kafka
- `8001` for Kafka Topics UI

# Quick Start

```bash
make quick-start
```

This command downloads the `master` branch from the [OpenWhisk](https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk) repo, it  builds OpenWhisk, the docker containers, it starts the system and it executes a simple `hello-world` function.
At the end of the execution it prints the output of the function:
```javascript
{
    "payload": "Hello, World!"
}
```

If `PROJECT_HOME` variable is set ( i.e. `PROJECT_HOME=/path/to/openwhisk make quick-start`)
then the command skips downloading the `master` branch and uses instead the source code found in the `PROJECT_HOME` folder.
This is useful for working with a local clone, making changes to the code, and run it with `docker-compose`.

## Updating OpenWhisk Invoker or Controller

To update the OpenWhisk Invoker or Controller without restarting everything, run:

```bash
make restart-invoker
```
This command destroys the running Invoker instance, waits for the controller to figure out the invoker is `down`, then it starts a new Invoker, also waiting until it's marked as `up`.

To do the same with the controller run:

```bash
make restart-controller
```


## Troubleshooting

* ```error: Authenticated user does not have namespace 'guest'; set command failed: Get https://localhost:443/api/v1/namespaces: dial tcp [::1]:443: getsockopt: connection refused```

  Make sure nothing runs on the above listed ports. Port 80 might be commonly in use by a local httpd for example. On a Mac, use `sudo lsof -i -P` to find out what process runs on a port. You can turn off Internet Sharing under System Settings > Sharing, or try `sudo /usr/sbin/apachectl stop` to stop httpd.

* ```error: Unable to invoke action 'hello': There was an internal server error. (code 5)```

  Look at the logs in `~/tmp/openwhisk` especially `~/tmp/openwhisk/controller/logs/controller-local_logs.log` that might give more information. This can be an indication that the docker environment doesn't work properly (and on Mac you might need to switch to use [Docker for Mac](https://www.docker.com/docker-mac).

* Check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-devtools/issues) for more.

# Build

```bash
make docker
```

This command builds the docker containers for local testing and development.

> NOTE: The build may skip some components such as Swift actions in order to finish the build faster.

# Start

```bash
make run
```

This command starts OpenWhisk by calling `docker-compose up`, it initializes the database and the CLI.

# Stop

The following command stops the `docker-compose`:

```bash
make stop
```

To remove the stopped containers, clean the database files and the temporary files use:

 ```bash
 make destroy
 ```

# Running a hello-world function

Once OpenWhisk is up and running you can execute a `hello-world` function:

```bash
make hello-world
```

This command creates a new JS action, it invokes it, and then it deletes it.
  The javascript action is:
```javascript
function main(params) {
    var name = params.name || "World";
    return {payload: "Hello, " + name + "!"};
}
```
The result of the invokation should be printed on the terminal:
```
{
    "payload": "Hello, World!"
}
```

Here is a [tutorial on getting started with actions](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/openwhisk-workshops/tree/master/bootcamp#start-your-engines).

## Install Catalog Packages

OpenWhisk has [numerous extra packages](https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-catalog) that are often installed into the `/whisk.system` namespace.

***These are not included by default with the devtools  `make quick-start` command.***

If you want to install these packages, run the following make command.

```bash
make add-catalog
```

Once the installation process has completed, you can check the `whisk.system` namespace to verify it those packages are now available.

```
wsk package list /whisk.system
```
## Updating Containers

If you want to pull new containers you can use `make pull` to update all the containers used in the docker-compose file.

## Install Feed Providers

OpenWhisk supports [feed providers](https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/blob/master/docs/feeds.md) for invoking triggers from external event sources.

***Feed provider packages are not included by default with the devtools  `make quick-start` command.***

Providers for the [`alarms`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-package-alarms), [`kafka`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-package-kafka) and [`cloudant`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-package-cloudant) feeds can be installed individually using the `make` command.

```bash
make create-provider-alarms
make create-provider-kafka
make create-provider-cloudant
```

Once the installation process has completed, you can check the `whisk.system` namespace to verify it the feed packages are now available.

```
wsk package list /whisk.system
```

## Logs

- OpenWhisk Controller - `~/tmp/openwhisk/controller/logs/`
- OpenWhisk Invoker - `~/tmp/openwhisk/invoker/logs/`
- `docker-compose` logs - `~/tmp/openwhisk/docker-compose.log`
- `docker-compose` feed provider logs - `~/tmp/openwhisk/docker-provider-compose.log`
- Feed provider instance logs - `~/tmp/openwhisk/<feed_name>provider`
- Action output such as stdout or console.log(): `wsk -i activation logs <activationId>`


## Custom Docker containers for actions

To start `docker-compose` with custom images used for running actions use the following 2 variables:

- `DOCKER_REGISTRY` - specify a custom docker registry. I.e ```DOCKER_REGISTRY=registry.example.com make quick-start```
- `DOCKER_IMAGE_PREFIX` - specify a custom image prefix. I.e. ```DOCKER_IMAGE_PREFIX=my-prefix make quick-start```

These 2 variable allow you to execute a JS action using the container `registry.example.com/my-prefix/nodejs6action`.

## Local Docker containers for controllers and invokers

By default this setup uses published images for controller and invokers from `openwhisk` namespace i.e. 
`openwhisk/controller` and `openwhisk/invoker`. To make use of locally build images you can use `DOCKER_OW_IMAGE_PREFIX`
variable i.e. `DOCKER_OW_IMAGE_PREFIX=whisk make quick-start`
